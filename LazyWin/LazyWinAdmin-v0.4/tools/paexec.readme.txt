Usage: PAExec [\\computer[,computer2[,...] | @file]][-u user [-p psswd][-n s][-l]
[-s|-e][-x][-i [session]][-c [-f|-v] [-csrc path]][-lo path][-rlo path][-ods]
[-w directory][-d][-][-a n,n,...][-dfr] cmd [arguments]

Standard PAExec\PsExec command line options:
-a	Separate processors on which the application can run with commas where 1 is the lowest numbered CPU. For example, to run the application on CPU 2 and CPU 4, enter:
-a 2,4
-c	Copy the specified program to the remote system for execution. If you omit this option the application must be in the system path on the remote system.
-d	Don't wait for process to terminate (non-interactive).
-e	Does not load the specified account's profile.
-f	Copy the specified program even if the file already exists on the remote system.
-i	Run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the specified system. If no session is specified the process runs in the console session.
-h	[NOT IMPLEMENTED] If the target system is Vista or higher, has the process run with the account's elevated token, if available.
-l	[EXPERIMENTAL] Run process as limited user (strips the Administrators group and allows only privileges assigned to the Users group). On Windows Vista the process runs with Low Integrity.
-n	Specifies timeout in seconds connecting to remote computers.
-p	Specifies optional password for user name. If you omit this you will be prompted to enter a hidden password.
-s	Run the process in the System account.
-u	Specifies optional user name for login to remote computer.
-v	Copy the specified file only if it has a higher version number or is newer on than the one on the remote system.
-w	Set the working directory of the process (relative to remote computer).
-x	Display the UI on the Winlogon secure desktop (local system only).
-priority	Specifies -low, -belownormal, -abovenormal, -high or -realtime to run the process at a different priority. Use -background to run at low memory and I/O priority on Vista.
computer	Direct PAExec to run the application on the remote computer or computers specified. If you omit the computer name PAExec runs the application on the local system, and if you specify a wildcard (\\*), PAExec runs the command on all computers in the current domain.
@file	PAExec will execute the command on each of the computers listed in the file.
program	Name of application to execute.
arguments	Arguments to pass (note that file paths must be absolute paths on the target system).

Additional options only available in PAExec:
-cnodel	If a file is copied to the server with -c, it is normally deleted (unless -d is specified). -cnodel indicates the file should not be deleted.
-csrc	When using -c (copy), -csrc allows you to specify an alternate path to copy the program from. Example: -c -csrc "C:\test path\file.exe"
-dbg	Output to DebugView (OutputDebugString)
-dfr	Disable WOW64 File Redirection when launching the new process
-lo	Log Output to file. Ex: -lo C:\Temp\PAExec.log
The file will be UTF-8 with a Byte Order Mark at the beginning.
-rlo	Remote Log Output: Log from remote service to file (on remote server).
Ex: -rlo C:\Temp\PAExec.log
The file will be UTF-8 with a Byte Order Mark at the beginning.

The application name, copy source, working directory and log file entries can be quoted if the path contains a space. For example:
PAExec \\test-server -w "C:\path with space" "C:\program files\app.exe"

Input is sent to the remote system when Enter is pressed, and Ctrl-C stops the remote process and stops PAExec.

PsExec passes all parameters in clear-text. In contrast, PAExec will scramble the parameters to protect them from casual wire sniffers, but they are NOT encrypted. Note that data passed between PAExec and the remote program is NOT scrambled or encrypted -- the same as with PsExec.

PAExec will return the error code it receives from the application that was launched remotely. If PAExec itself has an error, the return code will be one of:
 -1 = internal error
 -2 = command line error
 -3 = failed to launch app (locally)
 -4 = failed to copy PAExec to remote (connection to ADMIN$ might have failed)
 -5 = connection to server taking too long (timeout)
 -6 = PAExec service could not be installed/started on remote server
 -7 = could not communicate with remote PAExec service
 -8 = failed to copy app to remote server
